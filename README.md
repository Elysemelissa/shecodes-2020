# SheCodes 2020 Final Project

During lockdown in 2020, I decided to join a front-end workshop for women: SheCodes. This was my very first step into the world of Web Development, and also where I found out that I wanted to change my career and attend the <a href="https://lewagon.com">Le Wagon</a> Web Development bootcamp. 



<h3>My First Webpage</h3>
<a href="https://www.shecodes.io/">SheCodes</a> offers part-time coding workshops for women online. Their mission is to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. The beginner workshop I joined consisted of a basic 3-week workshop that covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As my final project, I built a webpage about Japan. I remember being super proud of it! :)
